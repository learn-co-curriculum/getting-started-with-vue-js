## Introduction

At this point, you should be fairly comfortable working in React. React continues to grow
in popularity, so taking the time to hone your skills is worthwhile, especially as you are
likely including React as a prominent skill on your resume.

However, if you find you are looking for a new challenge and want to expand your skillset,
there are other front-end frameworks that you might consider. One framework that is
rapidly growing in popularity is [Vue.js][].

Coming from React, you will see that Vue.js has some similar features that should make learning
the framework a bit easier than starting from scratch. For instance, both frameworks use components as
a method for building reusable chunks of code that get rendered to the DOM. In Vue.js, you build
'templates' to embed dynamic values directly into HTML, similar to how you can include
dynamic values or functions in JSX with React.

Vue.js provides [a comprehensive comparison between itself and React][compare] for a more detailed
comparison between the frameworks.

## Getting Started with Vue.js

The best way to get started with Vue.js is to read through [the official guide][], starting with 
installation. The guide includes many examples to help get you started. We also recommend checking
out [this beginners tutorial from tutorialspoint][tutorialspoint] for additional examples.

Since you already have experience in React, another way to learn the framework would be to rebuild
an existing React project using Vue.js. You will already have a sense of the project and how it is
structured in React. Rebuilding it in Vue.js will provide a good analogue and get you past the early
steps of deciding what to build and how it should be designed.
